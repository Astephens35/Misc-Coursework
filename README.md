# Misc-Coursework
Snippets of code from school assignments to demonstrate frequency and level of use in applied mathematics coursework.

### IncidenceMatrixOptimization.m

A class demo used when I was a teaching assistance for Optimization I. This Matlab code uses an example incidence matrix from a graph G and solves for the minimum vertex cover using integer programming.


### Monte Carlo Birthday.ipynb 

Calculates the expectation of the birthday queueing problem. As in, if we ask random people their birthday one after the other, how many are we expected to ask until someone has the same birth date (month, day) as a previous person?


### Coursera_assigment.ipynb

The final assignment from the Coursera course Introduction to Data Science in Python, which involves cleaning & manipulating data and running a t-test.


### Geometric Brownian Motion.ipynb

Simulating the Euler approximation of geometric brownian motion as well as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Matplotlib is used to graph sample paths, sample means, and true values of the processes over time. Scipy.stats is used to calculate p-values.
